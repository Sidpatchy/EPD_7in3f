# Image Converter
This is a simple tool to take a batch of images and convert them to individual files for use with the base library. While not ideal, this can work for small projects only needing a few images. 

## Usage

Ensure you have Pillow (PIL) installed.
```bash
pip install Pillow
```

Run Python script
```bash
python converter.py input/ output/
```
